Started on assignment 1.

This assignment seeks to have us create sine audio data and export it as a wav.
Additionally, the program must also play back the created audio data.

I began by creating the two required audio datum. 
I also created two helper functions to analyze the waveform and extract meta-data from the wav files for my own amusement.
